Conway's Game of Life in GoLang

Once I am able to work the GUI for this program, it will have the following features: 
	1. Two buttons: Play + Stop + Reset.
	2. A clickable screen with many squares...? I do not know how to name it.

The Play button will do the same thing whether the state of the program has just been reset or not.
The Stop button will pause the operations of the program. Basically just freeeze it.

The buttons Play and Stop are two sides of the same button LOL.
The Reset button can be callled whenever needed. If called while game is playing. 

The Stop function will be called then all instance variable values and screen will be reset. If called after the Stop button is called, only the second part will happen.
